# unity-roadnet
Road network in Unity, by using Unity NavMesh

Research and experimenting into automatic import of road network data to Unity, and the utilization also using Unity NavMesh systems for simple traffic simulations.

Live test / demo:

Current implementation:

Two lanes for Bike and Car - they go to their next waypoints on their own lanes. Not other features yet. Further requirements, and data import test set, being investigated for next steps. We tested DigiRoad and CAD based traffic network import, also to Unity RoadArchitect system, with promising early results in 2019. Looking forward to continuing this in 2020.
